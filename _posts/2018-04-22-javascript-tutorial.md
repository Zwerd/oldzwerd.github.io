It's been awhile, after I done work on my SQLi I tried to learn XSS and how it work, I found it fascinating! but I felt like I need more strong base knowledge about JavaScript to do my magic stuff. after week or two I decided to make my on tutorials about JS and this time in Hebrew, I learn a lot! and originally I wrote that tutorial for Michael which is a friend but unfortunately he give up on JS studies from some stuff else.

So here I am finding myself work on some tutorial that is basically designed for me lol!

On that tutorial I am working and learn every filed and chapter through w3schools, and in more few days I will be ready to take the exam.

The tutorial contain also some challenges that I found on the net and we solved it together, after that we will start to develop our won game! and do some more cool stuff.

I love JS, It is fun and challenge my mind how to do big stuff in short mount of time.


### JavaScript - the first video about the tutorial:
