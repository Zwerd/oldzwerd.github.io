My name is Guy Zwerdling. Iâ€™m a living in Israel, and really love to laugh, cartoons and animations, books, beer, Rock&Roll, guitars, and travel in little land called Israel. I also spend a fair amount of time cracking and build things together in Python, JavaScript and React-Native - not so long ago I finished developing my first application based on my dear brother's book.

I build this site to help other to learn and developed and do stuff, I think that it doesn't meter who you are, it's doesn't meter where you come from, it's doesn't meter who they think you are, all that meter is **what do you think about yourself**, if you have some dream go and fulfill it!

I hope that my work here will inspire other for they will do what they love no meter what and never give up, I sure that if you push hard enough and keep doing it, eventually you will be successful.

With great power comes great responsibility. The power is inside you!

Now I am searching for the next challenge!
